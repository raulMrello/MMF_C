\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_observer}{Observer} \\*\hyperlink{class_observer}{Observer} class represents the subscriber actor in a publish/subscribe environment defined by the \hyperlink{class_observer}{Observer} design pattern }{\pageref{class_observer}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_o_s}{O\-S} \\*\hyperlink{class_o_s}{O\-S} class defines the cooperative run-\/to-\/completion kernel. Tasks have fixed priorities and always is executed the highest priority one. Tasks can be suspended, yielded or waiting for a flag or a subscribed topic update. They can get activated due to these event sources\-: }{\pageref{class_o_s}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_task}{Task} \\*Tasks are pieces of software capable to be executed in a run-\/to-\/completion manner, this implies that they must return to allow other tasks to be executed (they never must block). Tasks can be S\-T\-O\-P\-P\-E\-D during initialization, W\-A\-I\-T\-I\-N\-G for an event, R\-E\-A\-D\-Y for execution, R\-U\-N\-N\-I\-N\-G during execution and Y\-I\-E\-L\-D if allow other tasks to take control of the cpu }{\pageref{class_task}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classmcu_1_1_timer}{mcu\-::\-Timer} }{\pageref{classmcu_1_1_timer}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_topic}{Topic} \\*\hyperlink{class_topic}{Topic} class represents the dynamic piece of software in which Observers can subscribe to get track of its evolution (updates) }{\pageref{class_topic}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structtopicdata__t}{topicdata\-\_\-t} \\*Data structure to allocate a topic update }{\pageref{structtopicdata__t}}{}
